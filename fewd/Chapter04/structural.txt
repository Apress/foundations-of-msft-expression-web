<p>Structuring Your Page Exercise</p>
<p>In this exercise we will be adding page structure. On real page 
most of the text would be in paragraph elements with a list or two 
and possibly a data table. In this exercise we will be using the different 
ways of structuring your page.</p>
<p>Begin with Headers</p>
<p>While a live page would have design elements such as mastheads, 
logos, and menus or exercise page will not be using design elements, 
sticking with the basics.</p>
<p>Lists as Menus</p>
<p>Most standards based web design uses an unordered list as the 
mark-up for navigational elements since semantically your site navigation 
is basically a list of pages within your site.</p>
<p>page 1</p>
<p>page 2</p>
<p>page 3</p>
<p>page 4</p>
<p>page 5</p>
<p>Tables</p>
<p>Should be limited to tabular data such as event information or 
a price list.</p>
<p>item no., description, price each, per dozen</p>
<p>1,red balloon, $0.25,$2.25</p>
<p>2,blue balloon,$0.25,$2.25</p>
<p>3,white balloon,$0.25,$2.25</p>
<p>4,silver mylar balloon,$1.75,$19.00</p>
<p>5,gold mylar balloon,$1.75, $19.00</p>
