<h3>Branding</h3>
<p>You don't need to go as high contrast as this to get your branding across.</p>
		</div>
	<div id="main_content">
	<h2>Overview</h2>
	<p>In this exercise we will be creating our website look and feel. Since there 
	is no content to be placed here yet placeholder, or what is called designer text, 
	will be used after this paragraph.</p>
	<h2>Created by the Press Release Generator</h2>
	<p>Thanks to the recent reorganization, the key players are not going to step 
	up to the challenge of competitive killer apps. Having first verified that the 
	drop dead dates give a clear channel towards quality control, a careful examination 
	of the writeoffs reveals that the scenarios provide an indication of the 
	established standard application framework.</p>
	<h3>Task-oriented disclosures make it happen. </h3>
	<p>As always, the workgroups empower compliant turnkey systems? Having first 
	verified that the goals enable kick-ass graphics, a careful examination of 
	the best systems in the world reveals that revolutionary RISC technology is 
	not the object-oriented headcount readjustments. </p>
	<h3>More Generated Content</h3>
	<p>Now that the merger is complete, content sweetening eventually closes the 
	loop on the issue of the team players. This is why Tom Jermoluk recently announced 
	that missions will succeed. The multimedia next generation system gets your 
	input on price-performance technologies. We&#39;re going forward on a binary-compatible 
	next generation system. </p>
